## üìÇ Key Directories

- **`prompts/`**
  - Entry point for all instructions.
  - Contains categorized prompt sets (`design`, `dev`, `deploy`).

- **`doc/`**
  - Knowledge base (architecture, naming, workflows).
  - Use only when a prompt lacks sufficient context.

- **`packages/`**
  - Contains reusable packages, modules, and frameworks.
  - Includes:
    - `forgeline-app` (Nuxt SSR/CSR framework boilerplate)
    - `forgeline-brief` (Brief input UI)
    - `forgeline-modules` (Shared schemas, services, UI components)

- **`core/`**
  - Contains core logic, automation tools, and services.
  - Includes:
    - Automation scripts (CI/CD)
    - MCP Server

- **`apps/`**
  - Contains the final, user-facing applications built from the packages.

## üß≠ Execution Rules

1. Execute inline CLI instructions or read referenced `@prompts/*.md` files.
2. If no input is provided, process the latest `.prompt.txt` in `/prompts/`.
3. Reference `doc/` for additional context when needed.
4. Apply all outputs strictly within `/apps/`, `/packages/`, `/core/`, `/prompts/`, `/doc/`.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Never modify files outside `/apps/`, `/packages/`, `/core/`, `/prompts/`, `/doc/`.

## üó£Ô∏è Language Guideline (Korean Response Policy)

- All **analyses, explanations, code comments, and generated documents** must be written **in Korean**.
- English technical terms (e.g., AWS Lambda, Nuxt3) may remain unchanged.
- Code comments (`//`, `/** ... */`) must be in Korean.
- Pure code content can remain in English.

---

‚úÖ **Summary:**  
Codex CLI supports both inline commands and prompt files located under  
`/prompts/design/`, `/prompts/dev/`, and `/prompts/deploy/`.  
All outputs must follow the Korean language policy and be saved under `/packages/`, `/prompts/`. `/doc/`.
